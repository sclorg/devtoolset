Developer Toolset from Red Hat Software Collections provides various tools for C and C++ developers. The Toolchain part of the Developer Toolset contains tools for building such applications (GCC compiler for C and C++, GDB, gfortran compiler, etc.).


Basic Usage
-----------
Suppose you have a source for a C application in the /src/app directory on the host and that we use the RHEL-based variant (Docker image called rhscl/devtoolset-6-toolchain-rhel7). To build such application you can mount the application sources to the container and run appropriate tools interactively:

    docker run -ti --rm -v /src/app:/opt/app-root/src:z rhscl/devtoolset-6-toolchain-rhel7 bash
    bash-4.3$ gcc -o foo -ggdb -g2 foo.c

That will compile one file from /src/app using GCC from container with options -ggdb -g2.

To run make non-interactively, run:

    docker run -ti --rm -v $PWD:/opt/app-root/src:z rhscl/devtoolset-6-toolchain-rhel7 make

That will compile the project from current directory using make utility.

In both cases above user must ensure that the directory where GCC will write data into is writable for the user used inside the container (by default UID 1001).
